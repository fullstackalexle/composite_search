# How To Use the Subtractive Composite - Prime Number Finder (Online)
1. Determine which prime decade (the range of 10 integers where we want to investigate, for primes). For example, if one wants to determine the primes within a given decade, say, 250–260.
2. Input a limiting odd prime number, found by taking the maximum from the given decade in Step 1 - so 260 divided by 3 is our limiting odd prime (86.66666667:~87), to generate a matrix for (in the input field), then hit 'Submit'. The SCPNF method will allow a person to determine the primes which exist three times beyond the limiting odd prime number [inputted; so the range is from the limiting odd prime to 3-times, the number of odd numbers extending from the limiting odd prime].
3. Now, use the 'Find' feature of your browser by pressing down the Command ⌘+F (MacOS) to discover the primes for all numbers from 1–260, by finding if specific odd numbers, using the finder - input an odd number that you suspect to be a prime, and to exist or not within the inner matrix. Numbers where the finder is not able to highlight/find that specified number, means that that number is a prime; and if it the number specified is found, then that number (within the inner matrix) is considered to be a composite.
